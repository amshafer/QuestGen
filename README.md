# FATE Quest Generator

FATE is a cool little game with a lot of procedural content. One of
the procedural systems is a random quest generator. I've extracted the
data in the form of a tracery grammar here. It isn't 100% accurate,
but it gets the job done.

*All data belongs to Wildtanget and the FATE dev team.*

I was traveling in the dungeon, when I was ambushed by Kazarmazar, a Ghost Valkyrie - it stole my GREATER HEAL, and made off into the dungeon! Please get it back for me! I followed it as far as level 9...
A Harpoon that has been in my family for centuries has been stolen! I've heard that a Yeti named Axdul has it, and that he roams the 8th level of the dungeon. Please retrieve it for me!
That sneaky Gorthain...at our last card game he cheated me out of my favorite Umlan's Piercing Gaze! Can you get it back for me? He's a Crystalon Herdling that hangs out on level 10 in the dungeon.
A Screamer that has been in my family for centuries has been stolen! I've heard that a Zombie King named Izukubal has it, and that he roams the 3rd level of the dungeon. Please retrieve it for me!
A Wraith called Kekthak attacked a caravan of goods bound for town, and took a valuable Spiked Hammer from the wagons!  It has retreated to level 3 in the dungeon. If you return it to me, I can make it up to you!
A Buckler that has been in my family for centuries has been stolen! I've heard that a Shambling Dead named Kungroth has it, and that he roams the 4th level of the dungeon. Please retrieve it for me!
Who will help us all? A very powerful Resist Ice Spell has fallen into the wrong claws - namely, Kabguzun. Track down the Boar where it lurks on level 3 in the dungeon, and bring the Fire Rain Spell back before it can be used for evil!
A Lunker Turbot that has been in my family for centuries has been stolen! I've heard that a Cave Giant named Khuzorzaral has it, and that he roams the 0th level of the dungeon. Please retrieve it for me!
That sneaky Garakzoth...at our last card game he cheated me out of my favorite Scorpfeline! Can you get it back for me? He's a WereBoar Ward that hangs out on level 10 in the dungeon.
Who will help us all? A very powerful Guardian Helm has fallen into the wrong claws - namely, Khormog. Track down the Greater Basilisk where it lurks on level 2 in the dungeon, and bring the Warhammer back before it can be used for evil!
