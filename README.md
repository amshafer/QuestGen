# Quest Generator

QuestGen is a text generator for video game quests. It uses simple
grammars to create a plot, and then fleshes out the passage using
GPT-2 completion.

The implementation is composed of two parts:
* `quest_gen.py`: A Flask server that (usually) needs to be publicaly
visible. It handles HTTPS GET requests for sentences that need to be
completed and returns the text generated by GPT-2.
  * To run this yourself simply do `python3.7 quest_gen.py`. Requires
  tensorflow to be installed
* `quest_gen.html`: This is the playable game client. It will make
requests to the server to get the generated text, and provides a
simple interface for completing the game.

Because running the server code is somewhat annoying, I have hosted an
instance of it here: [Playable QuestGen](https://badland.io/static/quest_gen.html)

Please email `amshafe2@ncsu.edu` if you have any problems running it.
